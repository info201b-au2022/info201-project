## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Deaths Based on Race in Different States

This graph displays the number of deaths that occur per race in a given state. When looking at different states. those with more diverse demographics such as California will see a wide variety in the race of those killed in violent police shootings, but those who are more majority-white such as Kentucky will see a much bigger ratio of White people killed. Native Americans, being a much smaller proportion of the population of most states, typically do not see very many deaths in any states, while White people, being the majority race in America, see a pretty high proportion of deaths cause by police officers in any state.

```{r chart_two}
# Example: a graph showing the deaths in California and another showing the deaths 
# in Kentucky:
race_chart("CA")
race_chart("KY")
```
