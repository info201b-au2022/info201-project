## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Police Killings in each state, compared to race and whether or not a body cam was used

The graphs produced by this function display the amount of deaths per race with a distinction of body cam usage. I specifically looked at the state with the highest poverty level(Mississippi), the state with the lowest poverty level(New Jersey), and one large state. I wanted to see if use of body cam footage differed between these states because of their poverty levels, while also looking at the death count. New Jersey and Mississippi didn't differ far too greatly in their use of body cam footage. However, New Jersey has a lot higher death count for Black people than the other states analyzed. For all the deaths that occurred, except for one in New Jersey, there was no use of a body cam. However, in a much larger and diverse state like California, there are many more deaths across all races, as well as more use of the body cam footage. Being that California is much larger and has a lot more deaths in general, the body cam footage usage also is more prominent, but still a lot smaller in comparison to all the deaths that occurred.

## Deaths Based on Race in Different States

This graph displays the number of deaths that occur per race in a given state. When looking at different states. those with more diverse demographics such as California will see a wide variety in the race of those killed in violent police shootings, but those who are more majority-white such as Kentucky will see a much bigger ratio of White people killed. Native Americans, being a much smaller proportion of the population of most states, typically do not see very many deaths in any states, while White people, being the majority race in America, see a pretty high proportion of deaths cause by police officers in any state. Lynne Peeples, a science journalist in Seattle, Washington, talks about how "data from California show that police stopped and used force against Black people disproportionately, compared with other racial groups, in 2018." By analyzing the proportion of certain races killed per state (provided by the graph) compared to the proportion of the race in the population, we should be able to see if there is indeed more proportion of certain races getting killed than there are in the population.

## Deaths based on Age in Different States

This graph displays the age distribution and frequency of victims in a given state. The age distributions in California and Kentucky are both right skewed. When looking at the minimums and maximums, California has significantly higher number of younger victims from police killing than elder victims from police killing, as well as a few high outliers; while in Kentucky, the number of younger and elder victims from police killing are much closer. Based on the age distribution of California and Kentucky, it is reasonable to infer that there are more police killing victims died at their early twenties or early thirties comparing to victims that died at a extremely old or young age.
