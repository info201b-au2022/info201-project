## Dynamic Paragraph

The data set consisting of all the murders committed by police in the United States from 2015 to 2017 is made up of `r summary_info$num_observations` observations, meaning there were `r summary_info$num_observations` recorded police killings in that time period. After performing multiple summary statistics on the police killing data set, as well as the United States poverty data set, we were able to get a general idea about what the data could tell us. The state with the highest amount of people under the poverty line was `r summary_info$max_poverty`, whereas the state with the lowest amount of their population beneath the poverty line was `r summary_info$min_poverty`. This information was important to us as we could see if there was a connection between statewide poverty and police brutality. To get an overview on the demographics of those killed, we found that `r summary_info$race_count`out of `r summary_info$num_observations` of those killed were people of color. When looking at gender, we found that `r summary_info$gender_count`out of `r summary_info$num_observations` of those killed were male.

## Description on the summary table
We grouped our data set by the feature of states. The table is included because the stakeholders can pull out the meaningful information and statistics related to police shooting of a certain state clearly and effectively. The table reveals the total number of deaths, the races of the victims, the ages of the youngest and oldest victims from each state, and the percentage of whether body camera is used. This summary table provides a brief insight of the police shooting data for stakeholders besides the data visualization charts. For example, if the stakeholder wants to have a glance on the races of police shooting victims in CA, they will notice the highest total number of deaths and the largest group of hispanic victims.

## Police Killings in each state, compared to race and whether or not a body cam was used

The graphs produced by this function display the amount of deaths per race with a distinction on body cam usage. I specifically looked at the state with the highest poverty level(Mississippi), the state with the lowest poverty level(New Jersey), and one large state. I wanted to see if the use of body cam footage differed between these states because of their poverty levels, while also looking at the death count. New Jersey and Mississippi didn't differ far too greatly in their use of body cam footage. However, New Jersey has a lot higher death count for Black people than the other states analyzed. For all the deaths that occurred, except for one in New Jersey, there was no use of a body cam. However, in a much larger and diverse state like California, there are many more deaths across all races, as well as more use of the body cam footage. Being that California is much larger and has a lot more deaths in general, the body cam footage usage also is more prominent, but still a lot smaller in comparison to all the deaths that occurred.

## Deaths Based on Race in Different States

This graph displays the number of deaths that occur per race in a given state. When looking at different states. those with more diverse demographics such as California will see a wide variety in the race of those killed in violent police shootings, but those who are more majority-white such as Kentucky will see a much bigger ratio of White people killed. Native Americans, being a much smaller proportion of the population of most states, typically do not see very many deaths in any states, while White people, being the majority race in America, see a pretty high proportion of deaths cause by police officers in any state.

# Example: a graph showing the deaths in California and another showing the deaths 
# in Kentucky:

race_chart("KY")
```

## Deaths based on Age in Different States

This graph displays the age distribution and frequency of victims in a given state. The age distributions in California and Kentucky are both right skewed. When looking at the minimums and maximums, California has significantly higher number of younger victims from police killing than elder victims from police killing, as well as a few high outliers; while in Kentucky, the number of younger and elder victims from police killing are much closer. Based on the age distribution of California and Kentucky, it is reasonable to infer that there are more police killing victims died at their early twenties or early thirties comparing to victims that died at a extremely old or young age.
